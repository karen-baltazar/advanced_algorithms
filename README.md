# Advanced Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various advanced algorithms developed for the "Advanced Algorithms Analysis and Design" course in C++.

## Algorithms:
- **Coin Change Problem Solver**: Solves the coin change problem using Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms.
- **Hash String CRC Generator**: Generates a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code for a text file using a hashing function.
- **Graph Coloring**: Implements graph coloring algorithms using an adjacency matrix representation.
- **Randomized Binary Search**: Implements the Randomized Binary Search Algorithm using Las Vegas Randomized Algorithm method.
- **Dijkstra and Floyd Algorithms**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm and Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the individual README files in each algorithm's directory.
